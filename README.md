# Trauma

**Tra**ck-**Î¼** **M**atching **A**lgorithms

Given an L1 TT Tracklet and an L1 regional muon candidate, classify the two as:
1. Signal (prompt) muon + signal track
2. Signal (prompt) muon + fake track
3. Displaced muon + fake track
4. Fake muon + fake track

## Getting Started

_NB: Thus far, this work has been performed at the LPC_

This project currently runs inside a CMSSW environment.
First, checkout the CMSSW release and relvant packages 
(following [these](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideL1TPhase2Instructions#CMSSW_9_3_2) instructions):

```
cmsrel CMSSW_9_3_2
cd CMSSW_9_3_2/src
cmsenv
git cms-init --upstream-only
git remote add cms-l1t-offline git@github.com:cms-l1t-offline/cmssw.git
git fetch cms-l1t-offline phase2-l1t-inegration-CMSSW_9_3_2
git cms-merge-topic -u cms-l1t-offline:l1t-phase2-932-v1.6
git remote add rekovic git@github.com:rekovic/cmssw.git
git fetch rekovic
git cms-merge-topic -u rekovic:skinnari-Tracklet_93X_resolved_932

git cms-addpkg L1Trigger/L1TCommon

scram b -j8
```

Now add our code (doing this after `scram` to separate compilation of 'central' and 'custom' repositories):
```
git clone https://github.com/demarley/trauma.git
scram b -j8
```

Then, anytime after opening a new shell, you can simply enter
```
cd CMSSW_9_3_2/src/trauma
source setup.csh
```
to set the environment.  Remember to re-compile anytime you change cpp code!

### Machine Learning Setup

The machine learning environment is currently un-tested (and not considered) for a CMSSW environment.
Instead, the training has been setup on a personal CPU in a custom python environment, built with Anaconda, to run on an NVIDIDA 1080Ti.
Work is on-going to modify this framework to run on the LPC GPU nodes.

To setup the machine learning environment, two extra modules are used,
[asimov]() and
[hepPlotter]() 
(if you are running on a new machine/environment, checkout `trauma` first):

```
cd trauma/
git clone https://github.com/demarley/asimov.git     # Keras+Tensorflow
git clone https://github.com/demarley/hepPlotter.git # Making plots with matplotlib
```

The wiki covers more information for running the training and inference:
- The [lwtnn](https://github.com/lwtnn/lwtnn) package is used to run the inference in a c++ environment.
- The [hls4ml](https://github.com/hls-fpga-machine-learning/hls4ml) package is used to convert the model for running on an FPGA.
